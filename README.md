A sample microservice project which the CQRS and Event Sourcing are applied using Java,
Spring Framework and Axon Framework.
The purpose is to provide a proof of concept for CQRS and Event Sourcing.
The functionality of the system is quite simple, but the architecture is quite complex.

and products for an imaginary shopping platform.
